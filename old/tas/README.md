version 1.3

This version uses a variable that is incrementing by 1 on every frame in order to determine the progress of the run, it's bad practice since it's unreliable when it comes to the player's FPS.

Uses unoptimized code, weird logic (lack of documentation) and it's hard to understand without comments.

The save file has tons of bloat, it's wasteful and inefficient space and it's difficult to edit some aspects of it.

To describe everything in one sentence: lazy and rushed work.


Therefore, use this version if you have no other option.
