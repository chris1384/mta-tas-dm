Added a preview of version 1.4, which fixes the notorious FPS dependent playback.

It has the basics that you'll need. Missing features are frame by frame, slowmotion recording, rewinding, warnings and advanced debugger.

Uses custom save format. Old runs saved with the old version are not available for loading.

WARNING: Loading a huge .tas file might screw up your game (infinite loop, memory fill or similar). It needs an async function.

I decided to make a revamp of it, please use the old version until this one is completed.
